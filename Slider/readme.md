🧩 How It Works (Simple Explanation)
1. HTML (index.html)

Creates the structure of the slider

Contains:

A box that holds all images

Next/Prev buttons

Small dot indicators at bottom

2. CSS (style.css)

Designs the slider

Gives:

Size and layout to the images

Smooth sliding animation

Styling to buttons and dots

3. JavaScript (script.js)

Controls slider behavior:

Moves to next image automatically

Moves backward when prev button is clicked

Jumps to a specific image if a dot is clicked

Keeps track of which image is active

Restarts auto-slide when you click anything manually
